# EV Travel Visual Comparator - First Sprint Plan

## Sprint 1 Goal: Basic UI + Vehicle Animation
Create a minimal working prototype with essential UI components and simple vehicle movement (no battery simulation).

## Technologies Selected
- **HTML5 Canvas** for vehicle animation and route visualization
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for basic movement logic
- **CSS3** for UI styling
- **No build tools** - simple file serving

## Sprint 1 Features (Implemented)

### Essential UI Components ✅
- Route visualization (horizontal line 0-1000km)
- Three vehicle indicators with distinct colors (green, red, orange)
- Play/Pause button functionality
- Speed multiplier dropdown (20x, 60x options)
- Time elapsed display (hours and minutes)

### Basic Vehicle Animation ✅
- Three vehicles moving from left (0km) to right (1000km)
- Constant speed movement (no stops, infinite battery)
- Different speeds per vehicle based on CSV data
- Visual movement along the route line
- Time-based animation loop with requestAnimationFrame

### Additional Features Implemented
- Distance markers at 250km, 500km, 750km
- Real-time position display for each vehicle
- "ARRIVED" indicator when vehicles reach destination
- Keyboard controls (Space for play/pause, R for reset)
- Reset functionality

## File Structure (Implemented)
```

│   ├── ui-controls.js (play/pause, speed controls)
│   └── data-loader.js (CSV parsing and speed calculation)

└── plan.md (this file)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Speed Calculation Logic
- Uses CSV data to calculate average speeds for each vehicle
- Considers first leg and subsequent leg distances/durations
- Converts to km/h for consistent animation

### Animation System
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- Time-based movement calculations
- Speed multiplier affects simulation time, not frame rate
- Real-time position tracking and display

### UI Design
- Matches prototype visual style with proper colors
- Responsive controls layout
- Clean, professional appearance
- Vehicle info cards with color coding

## Next Sprint Considerations
## Issues Fixed
- ✅ Fixed vehicle disappearing bug (NaN validation in animation loop)
- ✅ Added real-time console streaming for development debugging
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and input validation

## Developer Tools Added
- `dev-tools/console-bridge.js` - Real-time console log streaming to terminal
- `dev-tools/terminal-server.py` - Enhanced Python server with console streaming
- Comprehensive NaN validation in animation engine

This foundation can be extended with:
- Battery simulation and charging stops
- Cost calculations and input fields
- More detailed charging animations
- Enhanced visual effects and polish
